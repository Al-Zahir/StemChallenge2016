Changelog

Scene changes: 
	Added many angles to test
	The T at spawn can be added to test rotations (t.rotation = x and watching it)

PlayerClimbingControl
	-Made it so left and right determine if allowed to shimmy
	
PlayerIK added shimmy transforms

Idea is:
	Shimmy targets are the same as leftorigin and rightorigin, but are further and are not affected by smoothing. Due to this they can tell you if the player will be shimming off of the platform in the near future and therefore you can stop them. The check using the vector between left and right is not neccessary.

Added climbtimeout in playerclimbingcontrol (prevents player from messing climb up during a jump)
	-basically disables input mid transitions
	
Fixed hand rotation PlayerIK

Fixed error spam by setting left and right rots to Quaternion.identity at the start
	(Issue was a null quaternion setting the hand IK = internal crash)
